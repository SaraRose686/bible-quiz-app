## User experience requirements

* The starting screen should have a button that users can click to start the quiz.
* Users should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions that they can answer.
  * Users should be asked questions 1 after the other.
  * Users should only be prompted with 1 question at a time.
* Users should not be able to skip questions.
* Users should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score ("5 correct, 2 incorrect").
* Upon submitting an answer, users should:
  * receive textual feedback about their answer. If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer.
  * be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on).
* Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total questions asked.
* Users should be able to start a new quiz.

## Technical requirements

* Render answer choices in a `<form>`.
* Use semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery.
* Follow a11y best practices.
